			<div class="introchild1">
			RIDDIM! That wonky, bubbly, liquidy, bonkers form of Dubstep that all the cool kids love.<br>
			</div>

			<div class="introchild2">
			As genres evolve and relabel themselves, It's important to remember the classic tunes and the pioneers that made it all happen!
			That's why I made this site, to save, archive and share the classics with all fans of Riddim.
			Newcomers Welcome, grab some fire oldies if you've never heard them before.<br>
			</div>
			<div class="introchild3">
			I do not aim to be a platetraderboi. I seek to only post released/free tunes.
			Any artists who don't want to be here, any tunes you want removed, Let me know and I will do so ASAP. 
			I don't seek to be disrespectful, only to share classic and old works for those who love them.

			Any questions or contact info will be on the <a href="Pages/faq.html">FAQ Page</a>. Thanks Bruv<br>
