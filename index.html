	<h1>RIDDIM ARCHIVE</h1>
	<p>RIDDIM! That wonky, bubbly, liquidy, bonkers form of Dubstep that all the cool kids love.

As genres evolve and relabel themselves, It's important to remember the classic tunes and the pioneers that made it all happen!
That's why I made this site, to save, archive and share the classics with all fans of Riddim.
Newcomers Welcome, grab some fire oldies if you've never heard them before.

I do not aim to be a platetraderboi. I seek to only post released/free tunes.
Any artists who don't want to be here, any tunes you want removed, Let me know and I will do so ASAP. 
I don't seek to be disrespectful, only to share classic and old works for those who love them.

Any questions or contact info will be on the <a href="Pages/faq.html">FAQ Page</a>.

Thanks Bruvs</p>
