	</div>

	<div class="intro">
		<p>NOTE: This site is a WORK IN PROGRESS, There are no links.</p>	
		<br><br><br>

		<b>What is this site?</b>
		<br><br>
		This site is designed to preserve the amazing Riddim sub-genre of Dubstep.
		<br>
		I seek to create a one-stop place where anyone can easily have access to all the amazing tunes and artists that this genre has to offer.
		<br>
		I seek to allow people to re-discover amazing artists which no longer produce, but have made a lasting impact on the Riddim landscape.
		<br>
		If you are new to riddim and want to get in touch with the classics, this site is for you!
		<br><br>

		<b>I can't find this specific artist/song, what gives?</b>
		<br><br>
		Alas, I am only one lonely nerd coding this site, my collection is only limited to that which I was able to collect during my time in scene. 
		<br>
		(I got into the riddim scene in 2011, later than I would have liked, so there's still plenty I'm missing unfortunetly...)
		<br>
		BUT YOU CAN HELP WITH THIS!!!!
		I want to expand the library here, so if there's an artist or song I am missing here, Feel free to send it along here. (DON'T send me plates or paid tunes please, especially if you didn't produce them. They will not be displayed here.)
		<br><br>


		<b>I Can't Download the File I want. (Google Drive Error)</b>
		<br><br>
		My Apologies, Google Drive has a limit on downloads sometimes.
		<br>
		Let me what you were trying to get at this link and I'll put it back up ASAP
		<br><br>

		<b>I DON'T want my Artist Page/Song on your page.</b>
		<br><br>
		My Sincerest Apologies. With this site I aim to share released works and celebrate awesome riddim talent, But I totally understand if you don't want to be included.
		<br>Click This Link to give me the details, and I'll remove what you have requested ASAP.
		<br><br>

		<b>I WANT to include my page/music here so others can find me.</b>
		<br><br>
		I'm down as fuck, send me tunes/some bio info here and I'll start building your page
		<br><br>

		<b>I wanna support this site in some other way!</b>
		<br><br>
		Much love, sharing this site with anyone new or old to the genre is much appreciated!
		<br>
		If you are better than me at Webdesign/Coding (which is not saying much believe me fam), and want to help out, Hit me up hereeee!
		<br>
		Lastly, if you'd like to donate to help recoop the site costs, you can here. In NO way is this required.
		<br>To be honest, site costs are really low so far, so I'm not trippin. I made this site for the love of RIDDIMMMM (and to get webdesign practice lol).
		<br><br>

		<b>I have another random question, how can I contact you?</b>
		<br><br>
		Right Here, Bruv <3
