    | RIDDIM! That wonky, bubbly, liquidy, bonkers form of Dubstep that all the cool kids love.

    | As genres evolve and relabel themselves, It&apos;s important to remember the classic tunes and the pioneers that made it all happen!
    | That&apos;s why I made this site, to save, archive and share the classics with all fans of Riddim.
    | Newcomers Welcome, grab some FIRE oldies if you&apos;ve never heard them before.

    | I do not aim to be a platetraderboi. I seek to only post released/free tunes.
    | Any artists who don&apos;t want to be here, any tunes you want removed, Let me know and I will do so ASAP. 
    | I don&apos;t seek to be disrespectful, only to share classic and old works for those who love them.
    | Any questions or contact info will be on the 
    a(href='faq') FAQ Page
    | . Thanks Bruv
