      .question What is this site?
      br
      p This site is designed to preserve the amazing Riddim sub-genre of Dubstep. I seek to create a one-stop place where anyone can easily have access to all the amazing tunes and artists that this genre has to offer. I seek to allow people to re-discover amazing artists which no longer produce, but have made a lasting impact on the Riddim landscape. If you are new to riddim and want to get in touch with the classics, this site is for you!

      p Alas, I am only one lonely nerd coding this site, my collection is limited to that which I was able to collect during my time in scene. BUT YOU CAN HELP WITH THIS!!!! I want to expand the library here, so if there's an artist or song I am missing here, Feel free to send it along here. (DON'T send me plates or paid tunes please, especially if you didn't produce them. They will not be displayed here.)

      .question I wanna support this site in some other way!
      br
      p Much love, sharing this site with anyone new or old to the genre is much appreciated! If you'd like to donate to help recoop the site costs, you can here. In NO way is this required. To be honest, site costs are really low so far, so I'm not trippin. I made this site for the love of RIDDIMMMM (and to get webdesign practice lol).
