                  | As genres evolve and relabel themselves, It&apos;s important to remember the classic tunes and the pioneers that made it all happen!
                  | That&apos;s why I made this site, to save, archive and share the classics with all fans of Riddim.
                  | Newcomers Welcome, grab some FIRE oldies if you&apos;ve never heard them before.

                  | No Plates. We only post free tunes, or released tunes with Artist/Label Permission.
                  | Any artists who don&apos;t want to be here, any tunes you want removed, Let me know and I will do so ASAP. 
                  | I don&apos;t seek to be disrespectful, only to share classic and old works for those who love them.
                  | Any questions or contact info will be on the 
                  a(href='faq') FAQ Page
                  | . Thanks Bruv

      .question What is this site?
      br
      p This site is designed to preserve the amazing Riddim sub-genre of Dubstep. I seek to create a one-stop place where anyone can easily have access to all the amazing tunes and artists that this genre has to offer. I seek to allow people to re-discover amazing artists which no longer produce, but have made a lasting impact on the Riddim landscape. If you are new to riddim and want to get in touch with the classics, this site is for you!

      .question I wanna support this site in some other way!
      br
      p Much love, sharing this site with anyone new or old to the genre is much appreciated! If you'd like to donate to help recoop the site costs, you can here. In NO way is this required. To be honest, site costs are really low so far, so I'm not trippin. I made this site for the love of RIDDIMMMM (and to get webdesign practice lol).
